Specifically, for any subarray starting from index `i` to `j`, any two elements `nums[i1]` and `nums[i2]` within this range should satisfy the condition `0 <= |nums[i1] - nums[i2]| <= 2`.\n\nTo efficiently compute the number of such subarrays, we can make use of a two-pointer technique (also known as the sliding window approach). This technique will help us maintain a window of valid indices and efficiently expand and shrink this window to count all valid subarrays.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Initialize Pointers**: Use two pointers, `left` and `right`. `left` will track the start of the subarray, and `right` will explore potential end points of the subarray. Start both at the beginning of the array.\n\n2. **Sliding Window Technique**: Expand `right` to include more elements and check the validity of the subarray by keeping track of the minimum and maximum elements in the current window (from `left` to `right`).\n\n3. **Validity Check**: As you include a new element by moving `right`, check if the condition `0 <= |nums[i1] - nums[i2]| <= 2` for all elements in the current window is violated. This can be done by checking if the difference between the current maximum and minimum elements in the window exceeds 2.\n\n4. **Adjust `left` Pointer**: If the condition is violated, increment the `left` pointer until the subarray becomes valid again. Recompute the minimum and maximum as you increment `left`.\n\n5. **Count Valid Subarrays**: Each valid position of `right` defines several subarrays that end at `right` and start anywhere from `left` to `right`. These contribute to the count of continuous subarrays.\n\nHere's the implemented Python code using this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def continuousSubarrays(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        left = 0\n        count = 0\n        \n        # Min and Max in the current window\n        min_num = float('inf')\n        max_num = float('-inf')\n        \n        for right in range(n):\n            # Update the min and max for the current window\n            min_num = min(min_num, nums[right])\n            max_num = max(max_num, nums[right])\n            \n            # If the current window breaks the condition, adjust the left pointer\n            while max_num - min_num > 2:\n                left += 1\n                # Since we are moving left forward, update min and max\n                if left <= right:\n                    min_num = min(nums[left:right+1])\n                    max_num = max(nums[left:right+1])\n            \n            # Count subarrays ending at `right`\n            # Each position `k` from `left` to `right` is a valid start, so add `right - left + 1` subarrays.\n            count += (right - left + 1)\n        \n        return count\n```\n\nThis code efficiently keeps track of the subarrays that satisfy the condition using a linear traversal of the array with dynamic window resizing. By incrementally calculating valid subarrays ending at each `right` index, it ensures all continuous subarrays are considered.", "split": "test"}}

The operation allows us to merge two adjacent elements, `nums[i]` and `nums[i+1]`, into a single element which is their sum, and remove `nums[i]` from the array.\n\nTo achieve the maximum possible value for any array element, it is beneficial to always merge elements starting from the end of the array and moving backwards.

Set `max_value` as the last element because, initially, it's the largest element we can consider.\n\n2. **Traverse in Reverse**: Traverse the array from the second-last element to the first. This backward traversal ensures that we're always considering merging smaller elements into larger accumulations (stored in `max_value`).\n\n3. **Merge or Update**:\n   - If `nums[i]` is smaller than or equal to `max_value`, merge `nums[i]` into `max_value`, which means adding it to `max_value`.\n   - If `nums[i]` is larger, it means we have a new potential candidate for the largest value (`max_value`), so we simply update `max_value` to `nums[i]`.\n\n4. **Return**: Finally, after processing all elements, `max_value` will hold the largest possible value we can achieve by performing the allowed operations on the array. \n\nThis approach is efficient and works in O(n) time complexity as it processes each element exactly once.", "split": "test"}}

We will employ a technique that tracks the offset given by subarray operations.\n\nThe algorithm involves:\n1. Traversing the array while maintaining a `current_decrease` that represents how the elements have been decreased due to previous operations that are still affecting the current index.\n2. If an element is still greater than `current_decrease`, it means we need further operations on a subarray starting at this index. We calculate the required operations.\n3. The effect of these additional operations will extend `k` positions forward, so we adjust our tracking to account for them:\n   - Increment `current_decrease` by the required amount.\n   - Ensure this increment is rolled back at position `i+k` (if within bounds) by decreasing `current_decrease`.\n4.

This means that any element can essentially be transformed into a number within its specific range.\n\n2. **Overlap of Ranges**: To create the longest subsequence of equal elements, we want to find the maximum overlap of these ranges. If we can collect a lot of indices whose ranges overlap at a particular point (i.e., they can all be transformed into one specific number), we can have a long subsequence of that particular number.\n\n3. **Sorting**: By sorting the array, we facilitate determining which elements can be transformed into the same number. \n\n4. **Sliding Window or Two-Pointer Approach**: After sorting, we use a sliding window or two-pointer technique to find the maximum subset of indices whose ranges overlap at any point. This is done by examining consecutive elements and determining if their transformation ranges overlap.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumBeauty(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        nums.sort()  # Step 1: Sort the nums array\n        max_beauty = 0\n        left = 0\n        \n        # Step 2: Use the sliding window technique\n        for right in range(len(nums)):\n            # While the current range does not overlap within [nums[left] - k, nums[right] + k]\n            while nums[right] - nums[left] > 2 * k:\n                left += 1  # Slide the window to the right\n            \n            # Calculate the size of the window which gives us the number of overlapped ranges\n            max_beauty = max(max_beauty, right - left + 1)\n        \n        return max_beauty\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Sorting**: The algorithm begins by sorting the array. This is crucial for efficiently finding where ranges overlap.\n  \n- **Sliding Window Technique**: We use two pointers: `left` and `right`.\n  - `right` expands the window by moving to the right (expanding the window to check new elements).\n  - `left` contracts the window from the left while the condition `nums[right] - nums[left] > 2 * k` is true. This condition ensures that every number within the current window can be converted to the same value.\n  - The length of the window `right - left + 1` gives the number of elements that can be turned into the same number, representing the subsequence length.\n\n- **Optimization**: By using two pointers, we efficiently find the maximum length of a subsequence where all elements can become a single number, maximizing the \"beauty\" of the array. \n\nThis approach works efficiently in O(n log n) time complexity due to the sorting step, followed by a linear pass, which is optimal given the constraints.", "split": "test"}}

A string can be rearranged into a palindrome if at most one character appears an odd number of times. This fact allows us to use a technique based on bit manipulation to represent the character counts along paths in the tree.\n\nThe approach involves these main steps:\n1. Understand that the path from node u to v can be composed by intersecting paths from root to u and root to v.\n2. Use bitmasks to keep track of character frequencies on paths. Each bit in an integer can be used to denote whether the count of a corresponding character is odd (1) or even (0).\n3. Use XOR properties to calculate the frequency changes. Specifically, the XOR of two paths from the root will give you the path character frequencies from one node to the other.\n4.

This helps us efficiently manage which offers can be considered as we iterate over the houses.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Array (`dp`)**: We use a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum amount of gold that can be collected up to house `i`.\n\n3. **Iterating through Houses**: As we iterate through each house, we initialize our maximum profit without any new sales (i.e., possible carry over from `dp[i-1]`).\n\n4. **Considering Offers**: For each offer ending at the current house `i`, calculate the profit if this offer is accepted. This involves checking if the start of the offer is earlier than house 0. If so, it will simply carry the current profit `gold`, otherwise, it will add the maximum profit up to `start-1`.\n\n5. **Choosing Profit Maximization**: At each house, update the `dp[i]` with the maximum value by considering both accepting new offers ending at `i` and carrying over previous profits.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Finally, the maximum profit collected is available at `dp[n-1]`, which accounts for processing up to the last house or the last processed valid offer.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the maximum amount of gold you can earn by ensuring all possible competitive offers are considered without any overlaps.", "split": "test"}}

Use a sliding window technique to maintain the elements under consideration that fulfill the distance requirement, ensuring efficient updating of the sorted data structure.\n\nHere's the complete Python code implementing the described approach:\n\n```python\nfrom sortedcontainers import SortedList\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minAbsoluteDifference(self, nums: List[int], x: int) -> int:\n        if x >= len(nums):\n            return float('inf')  # There can't be two indices i and j with abs(i - j) >= x\n        \n        sorted_nums = SortedList()\n        min_diff = float('inf')\n        \n        for i in range(x, len(nums)):\n            sorted_nums.add(nums[i - x])\n            current_value = nums[i]\n            \n            # Find the closest values in the sorted list\n            pos = sorted_nums.bisect_left(current_value)\n            \n            # Check the element just before the current position\n            if pos > 0:\n                min_diff = min(min_diff, abs(current_value - sorted_nums[pos - 1]))\n            \n            # Check the element at the current position\n            if pos < len(sorted_nums):\n                min_diff = min(min_diff, abs(current_value - sorted_nums[pos]))\n        \n        return min_diff\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We use a `SortedList` from the `sortedcontainers` module to maintain a list of elements up to the current index minus `x`. This allows us to find the closest elements in logarithmic time complexity.\n- As we iterate from index `x` onwards, we update our sliding window of elements that maintain the `x` distance constraint.\n- For each new element added to our consideration (from index `i = x` onwards), we check the minimum absolute difference possible with elements processed so far.\n- This approach efficiently finds the required minimum difference with a time complexity close to O(n log n) due to the dynamic set operations.", "split": "test"}}

The transformation matrix is repeatedly multiplied by itself to efficiently compute the number of valid transformations over `k` operations.\n\n4. **Result Calculation:** Once we have the necessary number of transformations (captured in `dp`), we iterate over possible rotation indices and sum the number of ways the transformation can occur.\n\nThis approach provides an efficient solution by leveraging string matching algorithms and matrix exponentiation, leading to a complexity close to O(n + log k).", "split": "test"}}

A right shift is defined as moving the last element to the front of the array, and all other elements shift one position to the right. Given the constraints, we can use the properties of rotated sorted arrays to identify if the array can be fully sorted by some number of right shifts.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n\n1. **Identify the Rotated Point**: If the array can be sorted by right shifts, there must be a point in the array where it transitions from the largest value to the smallest. This is because the array must be a rotated version of a sorted array.\n\n2. **Check the Rotation**: We will check for this transition point. Once found, ensure that from this point forward, all elements are in non-decreasing order, followed by the start of the array up to this transition point.\n\n3. **Determine Shifts**: If such a transition exists and the order condition is satisfied, calculate the number of right shifts required, which will be the number of elements after the transition point.\n\n4. **Return -1 If Impossible**: If no valid transition point is found (meaning we cannot sort the array through rotations), return -1.\n\nHere's the implementation of the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumRightShifts(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        shift_point = -1\n        \n        # Find the transition point where a rotation might have happened\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Check if this point marks the transition from the largest to the smallest\n            if nums[i] > nums[(i + 1) % n]:\n                if shift_point != -1:  # More than one point of decrease means not possible\n                    return -1\n                shift_point = i + 1\n        \n        # If shift_point is -1, the array is already sorted\n        # Otherwise, shift_point determines the number of right shifts\n        if shift_point == -1:\n            return 0\n        \n        # Verify that from the shift point onwards, it's sorted till the end and loops back\n        if all(nums[(shift_point + i) % n] <= nums[(shift_point + i + 1) % n] for i in range(n - 1)):\n            return n - shift_point\n        \n        return -1\n```\n\nThis function iterates over the `nums` array to find the point of transition. Once identified, it verifies if the subsequent portion of the array is sorted properly. If these conditions hold, it calculates the necessary shifts, otherwise, it returns -1 if multiple transitions are found or if the array is unsortable.", "split": "test"}}

During the traversal:\n   - Calculate the sum of values in the subtree rooted at each node.\n   - Determine if a subtree can itself form a component divisible by \\( k \\). If the subtree sum at a node \\( v \\) is divisible by \\( k \\), we can consider removing the edge connecting \\( v \\) to its parent, as it forms a valid component.\n\n3. **Counting Valid Components**: Initialize a counter for valid components. Every time we can form a valid component (i.e., the subtree sum is divisible by \\( k \\)), we increment the counter.\n\n4. **Handling the Root**: Finally, if the sum of the values of the entire tree (root node) is also divisible by \\( k \\), it itself forms a valid component.\n\n5. **Result Calculation**: The result is given by the number of valid components formed during the traversal.\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the above logic:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Dict\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maxKDivisibleComponents(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], values: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        # Building an adjacency list for the tree\n        tree = {i: [] for i in range(n)}\n        for a, b in edges:\n            tree[a].append(b)\n            tree[b].append(a)\n\n        visited = [False] * n\n        component_count = 0\n\n        def dfs(node: int, parent: int) -> int:\n            nonlocal component_count\n            current_sum = values[node]  # Start with the node's value\n            visited[node] = True\n\n            for neighbor in tree[node]:\n                if neighbor == parent:\n                    continue\n                if not visited[neighbor]:\n                    subtree_sum = dfs(neighbor, node)  # Sum from the subtree rooted at neighbor\n                    current_sum += subtree_sum\n            \n            # If the current subtree sum can form a valid component\n            if current_sum % k == 0:\n                component_count += 1\n                # Return 0 because we are considering it as a separate component\n                return 0\n\n            return current_sum  # Return the sum to the parent node\n        \n        dfs(0, -1)  # We can start DFS from node 0\n\n        return component_count\n    \n# Example usage\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.maxKDivisibleComponents(n=4, edges=[[0, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3]], values=[1, 2, 3, 4], k=3))  # Example inputs\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **DFS Traversal**: This is crucial for calculating the sum of nodes in any subtree.\n- **Component Counting**: By checking the divisibility condition at each node and subtree level, we effectively determine how many edges we can remove to create valid components.\n- **Complexity**: The solution is efficient with a time complexity of \\( O(n) \\), where each node and edge is visited once.", "split": "test"}}

Each time it does, it indicates the end of a subarray, and we continue from the next element to try to form another subarray with a cumulative AND that eventually becomes zero.\n\nHere's how you can implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maxSubarrays(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Initialize variables\n        current_and = nums[0]\n        num_splits = 0\n        \n        for num in nums:\n            current_and &= num\n            # If the cumulative AND becomes zero, we can split here\n            if current_and == 0:\n                num_splits += 1\n                current_and = ~0  # Reset to all bits set (as in starting a new subarray)\n        \n        # If we made no splits, the entire array is one subarray\n        return max(num_splits, 1)\n\n# Example Usage:\n# solution = Solution()\n# print(solution.maxSubarrays([2, 4, 1, 1, 3]))  # Example Output: 3\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization:** Start with `current_and` as the first number in the list. This variable will track the current cumulative AND as we progress through the array.\n- **Iterating Through the Array:** For each element, update the cumulative AND. If at any point this AND becomes zero, increment the `num_splits` counter, and reset `current_and` for the next potential subarray by setting it to `~0` which has all bits set (equivalent to having no constraints yet on the next elements).\n- **Edge Case:** Even if no splits have occurred by the end (i.e., the entire array wasn't able to be segmented into subarrays with AND zero), return at least `1`, as the whole array itself is one subarray satisfying the condition.\n\nThis solution efficiently determines the maximum number of subarrays yielding the minimum sum of scores.", "split": "test"}}

Our goal is to buy the most expensive items last, as buying expensive items on earlier days results in a smaller multiplier compared to later days.\n\nHere's how you can solve this using a greedy approach:\n\n1. **Flatten the Matrix**: Convert the 2D matrix `values` into a 1D list while keeping track of all the values. This allows us to easily sort all the items irrespective of which shop they belong to.\n\n2. **Sort the Items**: Sort this list in increasing order. By doing that, we prepare to buy cheaper items on earlier days and leave the most expensive items for later, hence leveraging the increased multiplier.\n\n3. **Calculate Maximum Spending**: Iterate over the sorted list and calculate the cost for each item based on its position, where position also represents the day number if we buy one item per day.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def maxSpending(self, values: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        # Flatten the matrix into a single list of values\n        all_items = []\n        for row in values:\n            all_items.extend(row)\n        \n        # Sort the items in increasing order\n        all_items.sort()\n        \n        # Calculate the maximum possible spending by buying more expensive items later\n        max_spent = 0\n        total_items = len(all_items)\n        \n        # We use the 1-based index for days as per the rules\n        for day in range(1, total_items + 1):  # days are 1-indexed\n            max_spent += all_items[day - 1] * day\n        \n        return max_spent\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Flattening**: Compile all items into a single list regardless of their shop affiliation. Since values within each shop are sorted, this will help align them for the total order.\n\n- **Sorting**: Sorting in ascending order helps purchase cheaper items earlier (with smaller multiplication factors of earlier days).\n\n- **Maximizing Spending**: By traversing and calculating based on increasing day numbers and sorted item values, we ensure we spend the maximum possible amount, according to the problem’s constraints. \n\nThis solution efficiently maximizes the expenditure given the rules, leveraging a good understanding of per-day scaling in multiplicands and item value orientation.", "split": "test"}}

Here’s a strategy to solve the problem efficiently:\n\n**Strategy:**\n1. **Understanding XOR Behavior**: XOR flips the bits, so understanding the optimal way to align the bits of `x` with either `a` or `b` will help maximize the product.\n\n2. **Binary Analysis**: For each bit position, decide whether setting the bit in `x` will maximize the result. The maximum possible value at each bit can be reached by making `(a XOR x) * (b XOR x)` as large as possible by strategically selecting `x`.\n\n3. **Brute Force Limitation**: Directly iterating over all possible values for `x` (\\(0 \\leq x < 2^n\\)) is computationally expensive for larger `n`. Instead, compute outcomes based on bit positions.\n\n4. **Calculate XOR Maximization Per Bit**: \n   - For each bit from `n-1` down to `0` (most significant bit to least significant bit), choose `x` such that the bits of `(a XOR x)` and `(b XOR x)` are opposite, which should (except for some edge cases) help in maximizing the product.\n\nHere is a Python solution implementing this strategy:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumXorProduct(self, a: int, b: int, n: int) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        max_val = 0\n        \n        for x in range(2**n):\n            ax = a ^ x\n            bx = b ^ x\n            max_val = max(max_val, (ax * bx) % MOD)\n        \n        return max_val\n\n# Usage\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.maximumXorProduct(3, 10, 3))  # Replace 3, 10, 3 with your specific input values\n```\n\n**Explanation of Implementation:**\n\n- The solution iterates over all possible values for \\(x\\) from \\(0\\) to \\(2^n - 1\\).\n- For each \\(x\\), it calculates `(a XOR x)` and `(b XOR x)`, computes their product, and updates the maximum found so far.\n- The result is returned modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to stay within the problem constraints.\n\nThe crucial bit of this approach is it simplifies to trying all possible values for `x`, allowing us to compare each potential result directly without additional bit manipulation optimization.

It goes through the list starting from `i+1` to the end and identifies the smallest number that can be swapped with the current element.\n- We iterate over each element in the `nums` array.\n- For each element, we determine if there's a smaller element within the allowed range that can be swapped with it.\n- If such an element is found, we perform the swap and recursively call the function again to start over because any swaps can potentially open up more opportunities for other beneficial swaps.\n- Once no more beneficial swaps are possible, the array will be in its lexicographically smallest form within the given constraints.\n\nThis approach works well especially considering that the constraints may require revisiting the start of the list to ensure the globally smallest configuration is achieved through local improvements.", "split": "test"}}

It uses a frequency dictionary to ensure each character appears exactly `k` times and iterates through the substring to ensure each pair of adjacent characters are at most 2 positions apart in the alphabet.\n  \n- **Nested Loop for Substrings:** We iterate over all possible substrings of `word` using two nested loops where `start` gives the beginning index of the substring and `end` gives the end index (exclusive). `word[start:end]` generates all possible substrings.\n\n- **Complete Substring Counting:** For each substring generated, we use `isComplete()` to check if it is complete. If true, we increment our count.\n\nThis approach considers every possible substring and checks both completeness criteria for each.

Adjust frequencies accordingly.\n\n3. **Update Maximum Length**: \n   - After ensuring the subarray is \"good\", calculate its length (`right - left + 1`) and update `max_length` if necessary.\n\n4. **Return the `max_length`**: \n   - At the end of the iteration, `max_length` holds the length of the longest good subarray.

The operation allowed is to change any character to any other lowercase English letter, and we need to find the minimum number of such operations.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start by examining each pair of adjacent characters in the string.\n\n2. **Check Adjacent Pairs**: For each character in the string, check if it is almost-equal to the next one. If it is, we will need to perform an operation.\n\n3. **Count Operations**: Count the minimum number of changes required. If two adjacent characters are almost-equal, we can change one of them to a non-almost-equal character. The simplest choice is to change it into a character that's neither the same nor adjacent to either of the originals, such as 'z' (assuming neither of them is 'y').\n\nHere is the implementation of the solution:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def removeAlmostEqualCharacters(self, word: str) -> int:\n        if not word:\n            return 0\n        \n        operations = 0\n        n = len(word)\n        \n        # Iterate through the string and check adjacent pairs for \"almost-equal\" condition\n        i = 0\n        while i < n - 1:\n            # Check if the current and the next are almost-equal\n            if word[i] == word[i + 1] or abs(ord(word[i]) - ord(word[i + 1])) == 1:\n                # Increment the operation count\n                operations += 1\n                # Skip the next character since we are changing one of these two\n                i += 1\n            i += 1\n        \n        return operations\n\n# Example usage\nsolution = Solution()\nprint(solution.removeAlmostEqualCharacters(\"abccd\"))  # Example usage\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We loop through the string and for each pair of adjacent characters, check if they are almost-equal.\n- If they are, count an operation since either the current or the next character must be changed to prevent the almost-equal condition.\n- Increment the operation for each almost-equal pair, and skip checking the next character after making a change (to avoid counting the same pair twice).\n- Continue this till the end of the string.

This approach is similar to Dijkstra's algorithm, which is suitable for exploring the shortest path or minimum cost in weighted graphs.\n\n3. **Cost Calculation**: We iterate over each character pair `(s_char, t_char)` from `source` and `target` and calculate the minimum cost to convert `s_char` to `t_char`. If transformation is not possible, `float('inf')` is returned to signal that converting from `s_char` to `t_char` is impossible.\n\n4. **Total Cost Accumulation**: We accumulate the costs for each transformation. If any transformations are impossible, we immediately return `-1`.\n\nPlease ensure to run this in an environment where the `List` type is correctly imported from the `typing` module.", "split": "test"}}

Here's how the solution operates:\n\n1. **Find the Minimum Value**: The smallest element in the array (`mi`) is identified first because this value can potentially be used to eliminate other numbers faster due to the properties of the modulo operation.\n\n2. **Check Divisibility**: If there exists an element in the array that when divided by `mi` gives a remainder (i.e., `nums[i] % mi != 0`), it means that we can continue to perform operations to eventually reduce `nums` to just one element. This is because the modulo operation will not result in zero until they are equal.\n\n3. **Counting the Minimum Value**: If all numbers are divisible by `mi` (i.e., `nums` consists only of multiples of `mi`), then the array transformation isn't straightforward to reduce to one element. Instead, you must deal with pairs of `mi`. The formula `(nums.count(mi) + 1) // 2` calculates how we can combine these `mi` pairings to reduce the array to its minimum size.\n\nThis algorithm ensures efficiency by leveraging properties of numbers and the modulo operation to minimize the array size.", "split": "test"}}

This represents possible segment lengths that can be considered for forming a square.\n\n- **Main Logic:**\n  - Using the helper `f`, we calculate `hs` for horizontal fences and `vs` for vertical fences.\n  - The intersection `hs & vs` tells us the common segment lengths that can form a square, focusing particularly on the largest segment possible via `max`.\n\n- **Result Computation:**\n  - If a valid square dimension (`ans`) is found, its area is computed as `ans**2`, and the result is returned modulo `10**9 + 7`.\n  - If no common segment was found (`ans` is 0), the function returns `-1`, indicating that forming a square is impossible.\n\nThis solution efficiently determines the largest possible square area that can be enclosed by optionally removing certain fences, taking into consideration modular arithmetic for large numbers.", "split": "test"}}

Each operation allows us to replace two consecutive numbers with their bitwise AND. The goal is to strategically perform these operations to lower the overall OR result.\n\nThe strategy revolves around understanding how AND and OR operations interact. The AND operation will always result in a value that is less than or equal to the smallest operand, while the OR will accumulate bits from both operands. Thus, reducing certain numbers by ANDing them with others can reduce the overall OR.\n\nHere's how you can approach implementing the solution:\n\n1. We will evaluate what the result of converting pairs to a single value using AND would be.\n2. Track the impact of these operations on reducing the OR result of the entire array.\n3. Since OR keeps accumulating all the 1-bits from numbers, we must focus on reducing the most significant bits affecting our result in terms of position and value.\n4.

This ensures that each subarray has at least one element:\n     - Subarray 1: `nums[0:i]`\n     - Subarray 2: `nums[i:j]`\n     - Subarray 3: `nums[j:n]`\n\n3. **Calculate the Cost**:\n   - The cost for each partitioning of the array is `nums[0] + nums[i] + nums[j]`.\n\n4. **Iterate and Find the Minimum Cost**:\n   - Iterate over all valid combinations of `i` and `j` to find the minimum cost.\n\nHere is the Python function that implements the above logic:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumCost(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        min_cost = float('inf')\n        \n        # Iterate over possible i and j\n        for i in range(1, n - 1):  # i can range from 1 to n-2\n            for j in range(i + 1, n):  # j can range from i+1 to n-1\n                cost = nums[0] + nums[i] + nums[j]\n                min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)\n        \n        return min_cost\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Nested Loops**: \n  - Outer loop iterates through possible start of the second subarray (`i`), ensuring there's room for subarray 1.\n  - Inner loop iterates through possible start of the third subarray (`j`), ensuring there's room for subarray 2.\n\n- **Cost Calculation**:\n  - For each pair `(i, j)`, the cost is calculated as the sum of the first elements of the identified subarrays: `nums[0]`, `nums[i]`, `nums[j]`.\n\n- **Determine the Minimum**:\n  - Using a variable `min_cost`, we keep track of the smallest cost encountered.\n\nThis algorithm efficiently finds the minimum possible cost of dividing the array into three disjoint contiguous subarrays.", "split": "test"}}

If `x - k` or `x + k` exists in `prefix_sums`, it means we have found a `good` subarray.\n   - If such subarrays are found, update `ans` with the greater value between itself and the current `good` subarray sum.\n   \n3. **Update `prefix_sums`**:\n   - We update the dictionary for subsequent elements without overriding for smaller subarray sums.\n\n4. **Result**:\n   - If `ans` remains negative infinity, it implies no good subarray was found, and we return 0.

If a pixel doesn't belong to any region, its intensity remains unchanged.\n\nHere's the detailed Python code for the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def resultGrid(self, image: List[List[int]], threshold: int) -> List[List[int]]:\n        m, n = len(image), len(image[0])\n        # The result grid we will populate\n        result = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]\n        # To track how many regions each pixel belongs to\n        regions_count = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]\n        # To track the sum of intensities of regions each pixel belongs to\n        sum_of_regions = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]\n        \n        # Helper function to check if a 3x3 subgrid is a valid region\n        def is_valid_region(r, c):\n            # Check all pairs of adjacent pixels within the 3x3 grid\n            for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:\n                for i in range(3):\n                    for j in range(3):\n                        nr, nc = r + i + dr, c + j + dc\n                        if 0 <= nr < r + 3 and 0 <= nc < c + 3 and nr < m and nc < n:\n                            if abs(image[r + i][c + j] - image[nr][nc]) > threshold:\n                                return False\n            return True\n        \n        # Iterate over each possible 3x3 subgrid in the image\n        for i in range(m - 2):\n            for j in range(n - 2):\n                if is_valid_region(i, j):\n                    # If it's a valid region, calculate the average intensity\n                    region_sum = sum(image[i + x][j + y] for x in range(3) for y in range(3))\n                    region_avg = region_sum // 9  # Floor division\n                    # Update the sum and count for each pixel in this region\n                    for x in range(3):\n                        for y in range(3):\n                            sum_of_regions[i + x][j + y] += region_avg\n                            regions_count[i + x][j + y] += 1\n        \n        # Calculate the result grid based on sum_of_regions and regions_count\n        for i in range(m):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if regions_count[i][j] > 0:\n                    result[i][j] = sum_of_regions[i][j] // regions_count[i][j]\n                else:\n                    result[i][j] = image[i][j]\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**: We create the output grid `result`, a grid `regions_count` to keep track of how many regions each pixel belongs to, and `sum_of_regions` to accumulate intensities.\n\n2. **Region Verification**: The function `is_valid_region` checks if the absolute differences between any two adjacent pixels in a 3x3 subgrid are within the threshold.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Subgrids**: By iterating over the possible top-left corner positions for 3x3 subgrids, we check and compute whether they form valid regions. For each valid region, we compute its average intensity and update each pixel's contribution to `sum_of_regions` and `regions_count`.\n\n4. **Result Computation**: Finally, for each pixel, if it belongs to regions (`regions_count > 0`), compute its final intensity in `result` as the floor of the average of the region averages it participates in, using `sum_of_regions`. If the pixel doesn't belong to any region, its intensity remains the same as in the initial image.", "split": "test"}}

Here's a breakdown of the code and logic:\n\n1. **Hashing Class**: \n   - This class calculates a hash for each prefix of the string to allow efficient substring comparison.\n   - We use a polynomial hashing technique, where `base` is a predefined prime number to reduce collision chances, and `mod` is a large prime number used for modular arithmetic.\n   - The hash and power arrays are precomputed for quick access.\n\n2. **Substring Hash Query**:\n   - The `query` method returns the hash value of any substring of `word` using precomputed values, allowing O(1) access time.\n\n3. **Iterating to Find the Minimum Time**:\n   - The main function `minimumTimeToInitialState` iterates over the string with steps of `k`.\n   - At each step, it compares the hash of the current suffix with the prefix of the remaining string.\n   - If the hashes match, it means the segments are equivalent, indicating the string might be cyclic. Thus, the quotient of `i // k` gives the number of operations to return to the original state.\n\n4. **Edge Case**:\n   - If no matching rotation is found before a full cycle around the string's length, the function returns a calculation of `(n + k - 1) // k`, which ensures at least one full rotation around the string size. This computes the smallest number of operations needed to potentially revert the string at least once fully.\n\nThis method is efficient due to its use of hashing which allows quick comparisons rather than direct string comparison, reducing the time complexity significantly.", "split": "test"}}

To solve this problem, we need to select exactly `k` disjoint subarrays from the given array `nums` in such a way that maximizes the defined \"strength\" calculation. The eccentricity of the task comes from the alternating nature of weights for the sums of subarrays based on their order. A dynamic programming approach can be useful here. Let's break down the solution:\n\n1. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: We'll use an array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum strength using exactly `i` subarrays from the first `j` elements of `nums`.\n\n2. **Prefix Sums**: To quickly compute the sum of any subarray, we'll use a prefix sum technique. This allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in constant time by utilizing precalculated sums.\n\n3. **Iterate and Compute**: For each possible number of subarrays (from 1 to `k`), and for each possible end of the subarray in `nums`, we'll consider all possible choices for where the previous subarray might end, compute the strength for that configuration, and update our `dp` table accordingly.\n\nHere is a Python implementation of the above plan:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumStrength(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        # Compute the prefix sums\n        prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n        for i in range(n):\n            prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i] + nums[i]\n\n        # Initialize dp array\n        dp = [[float('-inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)]\n        dp[0][0] = 0  # No subarrays used, strength is 0\n\n        # Fill the dp table\n        for i in range(1, k + 1):\n            for j in range(i, n + 1):  # We need at least `i` elements to make `i` subarrays\n                for p in range(i - 1, j):  # Consider previous ending of subarray\n                    strength_modifier = (k - (i - 1)) if i % 2 == 1 else -(k - (i - 1))\n                    current_subarray_sum = prefix[j] - prefix[p]\n                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][p] + strength_modifier * current_subarray_sum)\n\n        # Answer is the best strength we can get using exactly `k` subarrays\n        result = float('-inf')\n        for j in range(k, n + 1):\n            result = max(result, dp[k][j])\n\n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Prefix Array**: `prefix[j]` stores the sum of the first `j` elements of `nums`. It helps calculate the sum of any subarray `nums[p:j]` as `prefix[j] - prefix[p]`.\n- **DP State**: `dp[i][j]` keeps track of the maximum possible strength using exactly `i` subarrays from the first `j` elements.\n- **Transitions**: For adding the `i-th` subarray ending at `j`, we consider all possible positions `p` to end the `(i-1)-th` subarray. We use the given formula to adjust strength using the weight `(k - (i - 1))`.\n- **Result Extraction**: The largest value in `dp[k]` gives the maximum strength attainable using exactly `k` subarrays.\n\nThis solution leverages the constraints and efficiently fills out the DP table to obtain the maximum \"strength\".", "split": "test"}}

Thus, the submatrices of interest are those defined from `(0, 0)` to some `(i, j)` where `0 <= i < m` and `0 <= j < n`, with `m` and `n` being the number of rows and columns respectively.\n\n2. **Calculate the Sums Efficiently:** For each potential submatrix from `(0, 0)` to `(i, j)`, calculate its sum. A prefix sum approach can simplify the sum calculation of each submatrix.\n\n3. **Count Valid Submatrices:** For each submatrix `(0, 0)` to `(i, j)`, check if the sum is less than or equal to `k`.

xj| + |yi - yj|`.\n\n2. **Finding maximum Manhattan distance**:\n   It is useful to realize that the Manhattan distance can be simplified by rearranging terms:\n   - `(xi + yi) - (xj + yj)`\n   - `(xi - yi) - (xj - yj)`\n\n   Therefore, to fully characterize Manhattan distances, we can consider the arrays formed by `xi + yi` and `xi - yi`:\n   - Find the maximum and minimum values of `xi + yi`.\n   - Find the maximum and minimum values of `xi - yi`.\n\n   The maximum Manhattan distance is thus determined by the maximum differences in these transformed arrays:\n   - `max(xi + yi) - min(xi + yi)`\n   - `max(xi - yi) - min(xi - yi)`\n\n3. **Minimizing maximum Manhattan distance by removing one point**:\n   - The task essentially boils down to checking, for each point, what happens if we remove it and recalculate the maximum possible for these two arrays.\n   - For each point, temporarily consider removing it, compute the potential new extreme values for the transformations, and determine the new maximum Manhattan distance.\n\nGiven this understanding, here's the Python code for the class `Solution` with the method `minimumDistance`:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumDistance(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        n = len(points)\n\n        if n <= 2:\n            return 0  # Only one or two points, removing any will leave max distance as zero\n\n        # Precompute all transformed values\n        sum_xy = [x + y for x, y in points]\n        diff_xy = [x - y for x, y in points]\n\n        # Compute global max/min for transformed values\n        max_sum = max(sum_xy)\n        min_sum = min(sum_xy)\n        max_diff = max(diff_xy)\n        min_diff = min(diff_xy)\n        \n        # Calculate initial max distance with all points\n        initial_max_distance = max(max_sum -

Given two characters `s[i]` and `t[i]`, the distance is the minimum of the forward and backward distances in the alphabet. This can be computed as:\n   - `dist = min((ord(s[i]) - ord(t[i])) % 26, (ord(t[i]) - ord(s[i])) % 26)`\n\n2. **Greedily Build `t`**: Construct `t` by replacing each character of `s` with the smallest possible character (starting from 'a') until the constraint on the distance `k` allows it. This ensures that we achieve the lexicographically smallest result.\n\n3. **Iterate Through `s`**: For each character in `s`, calculate the possible distance if we replace it with a character `c` starting from 'a'.

These are stored in a set called `substrings_of_length_2` to eliminate duplicates and to allow for fast membership testing later on.\n\n3. **Compare with reversed substrings:** Again, iterate through the reversed string to extract all substrings of length 2.

Therefore, our goal is to transform segments of length `k` into copies of each other with the smallest number of operations.\n\nWe can break down the string into segments of length `k` and count how many operations it takes to make them alike.

Therefore, if `nums1` has more elements than `nums2`, consider sums of removed elements and shifts.\n\n2. **Difference Calculation:** Since shifting by \\( x \\) changes each element in `nums1` by \\( +x \\), observe the difference between the sums of `nums1` and `nums2` after removing those two elements.

If two adjacent columns end up needing the same value, we'll need to change one of the column's values entirely, effectively adding operations equal to the column's height.\n\nLet's implement the solution step by step in the given method signature:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumOperations(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n        total_operations = 0\n        \n        # This will keep the value chosen for the previous column\n        prev_col_value = None\n        \n        for j in range(n):\n            # Count frequencies of values in the current column\n            column = [grid[i][j] for i in range(m)]\n            freq = Counter(column)\n            \n            # Find the value with the maximum frequency in this column\n            most_frequent_value, max_count = freq.most_common(1)[0]\n            \n            # Calculate operations needed to make this column uniform\n            operations_to_uniform = m - max_count\n            \n            if prev_col_value is not None and most_frequent_value == prev_col_value:\n                # If this column value would match the previous column value, we need to pick the next best option\n                if len(freq) > 1:\n                    # Find the second most frequent value\n                    second_most_freq_value, second_max_count = freq.most_common(2)[1]\n                    operations_to_uniform = m - second_max_count\n                    most_frequent_value = second_most_freq_value\n            \n            # Add to total operations\n            total_operations += operations_to_uniform\n            \n            # Update the reference for the previous column value\n            prev_col_value = most_frequent_value\n        \n        return total_operations\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Column-wise uniformity:** For each column, we aim to convert all cells to the most frequent value, as doing so minimizes the changes needed (`m - count` of the most frequent value).\n  \n- **Row-wise distinctness:** To ensure the same value isn't used in consecutive columns, adjustments are made only if the most frequent values of two adjacent columns match. We choose the second most frequent value as a backup option when needed.\n\nThis solution efficiently reduces the number of operations required by utilizing frequency counting and strategically selecting values to maintain distinct columns.", "split": "test"}}
